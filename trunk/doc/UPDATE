Update to V0.3.0.2

The update from version 0.3.0.1 to 0.3.0.2 needs two steps.

1. Update the database

   To update the database please use the little sql script provided with
   this update. The script update-0.3.0.1-to-0.3.0.2 adds one field to
   the table svnusers. The field is called "superadmin".
   


2. Update database contents

   For access to the svn repository using the http(s) protocol you need at 
   least on superadmin user. Select the user in the database and change the field
   superadmin to "1". Use phpmyadmin or a similar tool to do this.
   
   Create the svn access files. 
   


You're finished.

Update to V0.2.3

With version 0.2.3 md5 encryption of passwords is available. There's no need to convert
the existing passwords in the database. The encryption algorithm is checked automatically
and the passwords are treated accordingly.

If you want to use md5 encrypted passwords you have to add $CONF['pwcrypt'] = 'md5' 
to config.inc.php. 

Notice:
-------
When passwords are changed the encryption algorithm selected in the config file is used to 
encrypt the new password.
