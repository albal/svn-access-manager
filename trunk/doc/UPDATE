Update to V0.2.3

With version 0.2.3 md5 encryption of passwords is available. There's no need to convert
the existing passwords in the database. The encryption algorithm is checked automatically
and the passwords are treated accordingly.

If you want to use md5 encrypted passwords you have to add $CONF['pwcrypt'] = 'md5' 
to config.inc.php. 

Notice:
-------
When passwords are changed the encryption algorithm selected in the config file is used to 
encrypt the new password.
