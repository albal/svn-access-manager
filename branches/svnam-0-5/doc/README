SVN Access Manager Readme

SVN Access Manager is a powerful tool for managing access to subversion 
repositories. The tool provides user and group management and access 
rights (read/write) to dedicated paths in a repository as well.

Subversion grants access rights recursively. That means that creating
access rights to repositories is not as complex as it seams.

Let's have a small example.

Repository testrepo:

trunk
     /dir1
     /dir2
          /dir3
          /dir4
     /dir5

Let's assume that there're two users defined for this repository, user A and
user B. User A should have read access to the whole repository but should only
be allowed to write into "dir2" without the sub directories. User B should have
write access to the whole repository except "dir5". For dir5 he should not have
any access.

You can set the access rights with SVN Access Manager according to this created
access file:

[testrepo:/trunk/]
A = r
B = rw

[testrepo:/trunk/dir2]
A = rw

[testrepo:/trunk/dir2/dir3]
A =

[testrepo:/trunk/dir2/dir4]
A =

[testrepo:/trunk/dir5]
B =
