SVN Access Manager Docker Container
===================================

The dockerfile allowes you to create a docker container assembling SVN Access Manager 
with PHP7 and MariaDB. The container will build on current CentoS 7 base image. 

To build the container you can do the following:

1. Switch into the docker directory

2. Run the following command to create a container with the name svnamtest and version 0.1:
   
   docker build -t svnamtest:0.1 .
   

To run the container you can do the following:
   
   docker run --rm -d --name svnamtest -p 7280:80 svnamtest:0.1 
   
   
The container exposes port 80. The command above maps this port to the local port 7280.
You can access SVN Access Manager through the mapped port. 

Beside the exposed port the following volumes are available for external mapping:
- /var/log/httpd,
- /etc/svn-access-manager
- /svn/repos
- /var/lib/mysql
- /var/log/mariadb

The container has some test data loaded as well. The credentials you need are the following.

Username: admin
Password: Start!12345678


Have fun.
