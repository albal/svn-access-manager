<h1><a name="#overview">SVN Access Manager overview</a></h1>
<p>SVN Access Manager is a powerful tool for managing access to subversion repositories. The tool provides user and group management and access rights (read /write) to dedicated paths in a repository as well.</p>

<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>To use SVN Access Manager you need at least:
<ul>
	<li>a working subversion installation</li>
	<li>a MySQL Database, version 4 or higher</li>
	<li>an Apache webserver, version 2.0 or higher with DAV, mod_authz and SVN support</li>
	<li>PHP version 4 or higher</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Get the software</h2>
<p>First download the source archive from <a href="http://svn-access-mana.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<p>Installation is divided up in several parts. Just follow the instructions below.</p>

<h3>Install the software</h3>
<p>Go to a directory where the software can be accessed by your Apache webserver. Unpack the archive. That's it. Proceed with setting up the Apache webserver.</p>

<h3>Setup your Apache webserver</h3>
<p>Your webserver must know about the SVN Access Manager if it is not installed in the DocumentRoot of your webserver. In the latter case you can include a line similar to this in your webserver configuration:</p>
<code>
Alias /svnaccessmanager /[path_to_svn_access_manager]/svn_access_manager
</code>
<p>After adding this don't forget to reload your webserver to make sure the configuration changes are active.</p>

<h3>Setup a MySQL database and a database user</h3>
<p>You need a database for SVN Access manager and an user with full access to this database. To create the database do the following as root user of your MySQL database:</p>
<code>
CREATE DATABASE svnadmin;
</code>
<p>To create a user having access to this database do the following as root user of your MySQL database:</p>
<pre>
CREATE USER 'svnadmin'@ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '*******';

GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO 'svnadmin'@ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '*******' 
            WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 
                 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `svnadmin` . * TO 'svnadmin'@ 'localhost';
</pre>
<p>After finishing the database work continue with installing SVN Access Manager.</p>

<h3><a name="installer">Using the installer</a></h3>
<p><strong><u>Important notice:</u></strong><br />Please remove the installer script after finishing the installation. It is a security risk to have the installer on a global accessable site!</p>
<p>The installer ist started by entering the following URL into your web browser presuming that you have the alias mentioned above. Otherwise please fill in the values fitting your installation: </p>
<code>
http(s)://[your_domain]/svnaccessmanager/install/install.php
</code>
<p>It is recommended to use https to access the installer because of the fact that passwords are sent to the webserver!</p>
