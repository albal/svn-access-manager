	  has to use all for groups, a normal user has to use three groups at least. Two constants are 
	  added ($CONF['minPasswordGroups'] and $CONF['minPasswordGroupsUser']) to enable configuration.
	  If not set or out of range (1 - 4) 3 is assumed for normal users and 4 is assumed for 
	  administrators.

	- added functionality to create repositories from the web interface. This only works if SVN Access Manager 
	  is running on the same hosts where the repositories live. This is due to the fact that svnadmin only
	  accepts a path not an URL.
