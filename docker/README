SVN Access Manager Docker Container
===================================

The dockerfile allowes you to create a docker container assembling SVN Access Manager 
with PHP7 and MariaDB. The container will build on current CentoS 7 base image. 

To build the container you can do the following:

1. Switch into the docker directory

2. Run the following command to create a container with the name svnamtest and version 0.1:
   
   docker build -t svnamtest:0.1 .
   

To run the container you can do the following:
   
   docker run --rm -d --name svnamtest -p 7280:80 svnamtest:0.1 
   
   
The container exposes port 80. The command above maps this port to the local port 7280.

Beside the exposed port the following volumes are available for external mapping:
- /var/log/httpd,
- /etc/svn-access-manager
- /svn/repos
- /var/lib/mysql
- /var/log/mariadb

Have fun.
